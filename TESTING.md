How I tested endpoints:

I used pgAdmin to view my tables manually and test whether my POST request were working as intended sending the correct data to the database

Furthermore, also viewed the table when testing my delete feature to see if it removed the information from the table.

Also used console to see whether my code was being executed correctly and at what line it stopped.
